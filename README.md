A Spring Framework based Java application. The making of this web app was
a part of a Java Developer programming course that I have recently completed.
I have added an sql file with some initial data for a db and put it inside
the 'resources' folder.

As for the testing, each user's/admin's password is "P@ssword09".

superadmin: charityapp2021@gmail.com
admin: admin@charity.com
user: aaa@alphabet.com
user: bbb@alphabet.com
user: ccc@alphabet.com
user: ddd@alphabet.com
user: eee@alphabet.com
user: fff@alphabet.com
user: ggg@alphabet.com
